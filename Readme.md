#Bascket ball coach application.
Smart basketball coach is a system which is able to act as a basketball player’s coach and train the player like a human coach. It can be able to analyse the player’s performance in better manner and it give progress on players performances. It will give real time feed backs and comments regarding how the player is practicing at the moment.

System will observe a basketball player shooting from a distance and get the details/parameters on the shooting process such as shooting speed, player’s position, whether the shooting is successful or not, trajectory of the ball etc.. Then those parameters are sent to trained neural network to get the feed backs,comments and give suggestions to improve their playing. On every time the progress of the player is recorded and the data will be analysed to give a progress report.

Currently we are working on implement the system on a powerful desktop computer as a prototype.
